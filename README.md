# firstrepository

The purpose of creating this repository was to be able to uplead files for a Software Develeopment college project, so that the files can be easily accessed from anywhere and
to get more farmiliar with bash commands.
Over the last couple of weeks, the class was required to develope and application. Every week, we developed code to preform several tasks such as preforming arithmatic, converting
celsius to fahrenheit or searching for information from an array. We created a main menu for the application, called Index, which displayes all the available functions and
allows the user to choses which action to take. After that task was performed, the application would bring the user back to the main menu where it's possible to chose another task.
If the user wished, they also have the option to terminate the program. 

To clone this repository, first you will have to install the Git Bash command promp on your computer. 
From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository.
When that is done, simple copy the url of this repository.
Then open the Git Bash command prompt and type git clone, paste the url and press enter.
If the clone was succesful, a new sub directory should appear on your drive. This has the same name as the repository you have cloned.
